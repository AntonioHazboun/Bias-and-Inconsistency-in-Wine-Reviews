# Bias-and-Inconsistency-in-Wine-Reviews
Adapted from a data analysis project in which my team members and I scraped the web of different wine reviews and compared the reviews of different critics for the same wine to identify the extent to which they agreed or disagreed. Standard hypothesis tests were conducted to identify if the bias in ratings was statistically significant.
